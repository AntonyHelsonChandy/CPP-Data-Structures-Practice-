#<h1>C++ Data Structures Practice:</h1>
<i>A <b>data structure</b> is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.</i> 
<h4>Linear Data Structure:</h4>
<i>Data structure where data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly where the elements are attached to its previous and next adjacent in what is called a linear data structure. In linear data structure, single level is involved. Therefore, we can traverse all the elements in single run only. Its examples are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.</i>
<h4>Non-linear Data Structure:</h4>
<i>Data structures where data elements are not arranged sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In a non-linear data structure, single level is not involved. Therefore, we canâ€™t traverse all the elements in single run only. It utilizes computer memory efficiently in comparison to a linear data structure. Its examples are trees and graphs.</i>
